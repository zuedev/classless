        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
          I'm really picky with my CSS styling, and I hate class-heavy CSS
          frameworks, so I made this! The main goal of this project is to
          provide a lightweight, clean-looking, and style-agnostic base that I
          like the look of.
        </p>
        <h2>What does it look like?</h2>
        <p>
          You're looking at it right now! For a more detailed breakdown, check
          out the <a href="javascript:goto('#cookbook')">cookbook</a>.

          This is a paragraph of text but did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth
          Plagueis the Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell
          you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith,
          so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the
          midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark
          side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The
          dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to
          be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of
          was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did.
          Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his
          apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others
          from death, but not himself.
